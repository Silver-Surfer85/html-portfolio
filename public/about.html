<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 38 year proud husband of a <em>BEAUTIFUL</em> wife and 2 kids.<br>
I enjoy things like fishing, camping, watching College Football, most sports watching<br>
and most of all time with my family.  I love the new journey we are on and hope the old chapter<br>
book we had has turned its last page and now we are off on a new book with fresh chapters.</p>

<p>Coding is something i love and it's like music to my ears, literally. When I hear<br>
a Piano playing I get all excited inside.  Coding and running code, learning to debug code<br>
is just one thing i can't wait to have a better grasp on.</p>

<p>Lastly, I hope to develop web pages, debug code, and make apps.  A goal of mine is to<br>
Freelance this and make good money, and for my age, with hard work and dedication, who knows,<br>
I may end up getting hired as a Web DEV working Devops with someone one day, maybe it lands me <br>
near the debug/cyber community.</p>
